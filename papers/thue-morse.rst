Extending The Prouhet-Thue-Morse Sequence (Preprint)
####################################################

This (preprint) `paper <https://github.com/LivInTheLookingGlass/Thue-Morse>`__ is part literature review, and part original research. In the first section, it collects as many definitions of the sequence as possible, then proves they are consistent with each other. In the next, it extends the sequence from an alphabet of size 2 to an alphabet of size n. It also discusses a number of other extensions in existing literature, and why they are not consistent with the straightforward extension that is used by most definitions in this paper. To the best of my knowledge, 6 of the definitions in this paper are original, and no similar research has yet been done.
