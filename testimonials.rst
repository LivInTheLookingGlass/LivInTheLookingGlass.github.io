Ben Sanchez (Intel, Product Development Engineer)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  She came to me with a reputation as an expert coder with excellent attention to detail. [...] Shortly after
  Olivia was assigned to work with me, I was assigned to a project [that] was very challenging
  & required a great deal of detailed work in previously uncharted technical territory. Olivia was tasked
  with the analysis of existing specifications and our initial implementations of those, as well as changes
  made to both as the work progressed. Throughout the project Olivia and I worked hand in hand to
  complete the architecture, to document that, to oversee the implementation of that architecture in our
  products, and to define the test cases required to validate the feature as implemented. Olivia was also
  instrumental in the execution of those tests, the collection of data from that execution, and the analysis
  of the results to determine if tests had passed or failed. In the case of failing tests Olivia helped to
  determine the root cause of the failure, to work with firmware and other engineering teams to
  implement fixes to the product implementation, and to re-test the final implementation to be sure it
  met specified criteria.

  Throughout that work Olivia showed her intelligence and aptitude to the diverse tasks at hand. I would
  not have expected an average intern to have performed so well in this environment. I found Olivia to be
  quite capable of following instructions, as well as independently working to overcome issues during this
  project, and later on after her internship. After her internship ended Olivia was offered, and accepted, a
  full-time position as a peer of mine. She and I continued to work together for the better part of a year
  until I moved on to a new position. Throughout that time, I continued to be impressed with Olivia's
  ability given her relative lack of experience. She outperforms some experienced engineers I work with.
