About Me
========

I joined the `TMW Center <https://tmwcenter.uchicago.edu/>`__ in 2024. As an `Applied Data Fellow </jobs/2024-tmw.html>`__, I support development on the SPEAK-CAT tool, as well as providing general debugging for other projects. I am especially involved in test development and quality assurance.

Prior to the TMW Center, I got my Bachelor's degree at `Northern Michigan University </education/2_undergrad.html>`__. During and after this, I worked at `Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) </jobs.html##intel-non-volatile-memory-solutions-group>`__. My various roles there included managing firmware distribution, designing hardware test protocols, and developing/maintaining in-house tools. After this, I got my Master's degree at `Michigan State University </education/1_grad.html>`__, where my research was largely focused on distributed systems. It was there that I discovered my deep love for teaching, and enhanced my desire to continue learning wherever possible.

I have been a hobbyist sysadmin for about a decade, and maintain my own personal server. I also contributed to several open source projects, including `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/LivInTheLookingGlass>`__, `CPython </work/minor/cpython.html>`__, `attrs </work/minor/attrs.html>`__, and `base58 </work/minor/base58.html>`__, among others.

I live in Chicago, which was always been a dream of mine.
