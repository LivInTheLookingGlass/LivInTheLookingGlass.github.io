About Me
========

Olivia joined the TMW Center in 2024. As an Applied Data Fellow, she supports development on the SPEAK-CAT tool, as well as providing general debugging for other projects. She is especially involved in test development and quality assurance.

Prior to the TMW Center, she got her Bachelor's degree at Northern Michigan University. During and after this, she worked at Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG). Her various roles there included managing firmware distribution, designing hardware test protocols, and developing/maintaining in-house tools. After this, she got her Master's degree at Michigan State University, where her research was largely focused on distributed systems. It was there that she discovered her deep love for teaching, and enhanced her desire to continue learning wherever possible.

She lives in Chicago, which has always been a dream of hers.
