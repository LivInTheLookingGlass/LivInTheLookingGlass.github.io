ISS Tracking Pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`This fork <https://github.com/LivInTheLookingGlass/ISS-Tracking-Pointer/tree/aruino-101-port>`__ was aimed at porting some existing code to the Arduino 101, as it could not compile as-is. Code size needed to be significantly reduced in order for it to fit in memory, among other problems.
