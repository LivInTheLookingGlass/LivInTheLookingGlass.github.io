Job-Splitter + Progress-Pool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`These <https://github.com/LivInTheLookingGlass/job-splitter>`__ two `projects <https://github.com/LivInTheLookingGlass/progress-pool>`__ were born out of my need, in grad school, to distribute simulations across multiple disconnected computers. You would enter the number of cores in each, and a rough performance adjustment factor. It would then deterministically split the jobs between the different nodes, and print progress as it ran jobs on all available cores.
