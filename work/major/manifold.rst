Manifold Markets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two projects related to `this website <https://manifold.markets/>`__. The first is `PyManifold <https://github.com/bcongdon/PyManifold>`__, to which I contributed most of the API calls, especially those that write to the site. The second is `ManifoldMarketManager <https://github.com/LivInTheLookingGlass/ManifoldMarketManager>`__, which was a rules-based oracle for the site. It could do things like lotteries, or artificially leveraged odds, or requesting a human judgement via Telegram. It could also do any combination of logical operators on those rules.

These projects are now defunct, as the targeted website has a very fast-moving API.
