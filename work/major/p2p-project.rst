P2P Project
###########

`This project <https://github.com/p2p-today/p2p-project>`__ was my dissertation for `undergrad </education/2_undergrad.html>`_. It consisted of an implementation of inter-operable peer-to-peer networks in both JavaScript and Python, as well as the framework to implement it in C, C++, Java, and SmallTalk. It came with significant documentation and a tech demo.
