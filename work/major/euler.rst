Project Euler
#############

`Project Euler <projecteuler.net>`_ is a set of mathematics problems meant for programmers. Each problem is intended to be solvable in less than 60 seconds of runtime, but some are quite complicated, and ideal solutions often rely on number theory and other branches of mathematics to work. My goal in particular is to solve problems in as many languages as feasible, both to learn them and to demonstrate proficiency.
