OpenStreetMap Contributions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ is a global Geographic Information System built in a similar style to Wikipedia. It is used as a data source by a great variety of people and tools, including:

- CraigsList
- Facebook
- Flickr
- Foursquare
- Snapchat
- Bing Maps (derived)
- Pokemon Go (derived)
- the American and British Red Cross
- USAID

I have contributed to this in a variety of ways. I organized multiple emergency relief map-a-thons during my time at Intel
(`example <https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/LivInTheLookingGlass/diary/368798>`__). I wrote open source tools (`overpassify </work/major/overpassify.html>`__)
that allow for easier geospatial analysis. I've contributed to many bug reports on tools such as StreetComplete and iD, which are editors for OpenStreetMap.
