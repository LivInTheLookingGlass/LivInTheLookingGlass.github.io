Base58 Contributions
++++++++++++++++++++

The base58 library implements an encoding scheme used in a large number of cryptocurrency applications. This scheme is useful because, unlike base64, it is significantly more human readable due to exclusion of look-alike characters. It has recently seen greater adoption outside of cryptocurrency spaces. I made several contributions to this library, namely:

- `Adding additional tests <https://github.com/keis/base58/pull/10>`__
- `Adding support for directly encoding integers <https://github.com/keis/base58/pull/12>`__
- `Providing optimizations <https://github.com/keis/base58/pull/14>`__
