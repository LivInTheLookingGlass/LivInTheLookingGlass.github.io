u-msgpack-python Contributions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This serialization library implements the `MessagePack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack>`__ protocol, which provides binary encoding of data in a JSON-like structure, while minimizing data size at time of transmission. I contributed several patches to this library, including:

- `Inherit from object to allow for cleaner python2 inheritence <https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python/pull/35>`__
- `two <https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python/pull/36>`__ patches for `performance <https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python/pull/38>`__ tuning
- `Eliminate a DeprecationWarning <https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python/pull/42>`__
- `Support more complicated inheritence schemes <https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python/pull/45>`__
