attrs
~~~~~

Attrs is a Python library that inspired the standard library `dataclasses <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`__ module. It has a number of convenience features for making complex data structures. My contribution was to make their `_Nothing object a singleton <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/pull/433>`__, meaning that there is only ever one copy of it.
