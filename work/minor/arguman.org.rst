Arguman.org
~~~~~~~~~~~

This website allows people to format arguments as a tree, so one can lay out all the counterpoints and evidence in favor of given positions. While these days the site is exclusively in Turkish, at the time of my contribution they had a significant English-speaking presence as well. I contributed a patch which `added links to a notification type <https://github.com/arguman/arguman.org/pull/261>`__.
