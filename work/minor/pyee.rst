Python EventEmitter (pyee)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This library contains an implementation of the `EventEmitter <https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/the-nodejs-event-emitter>`__ class from JavaScript. I provided several contributions to this, namely:

- `Fixing complex inheritence <https://github.com/jfhbrook/pyee/pull/32>`__
- `Add wheels to the distribution scheme <https://github.com/jfhbrook/pyee/pull/35>`__
- `Enable being serialized by pickle and similar <https://github.com/jfhbrook/pyee/pull/117>`__
